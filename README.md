Our aim is to analyze the impact of the macroeconomic situation on decision-makers in the corporate sector and on economic policy-making. To this end, our study focuses on BATI (a fictitious company), a leader in the construction sector in mainland France, holding 90% of market share and generating all its sales in France.

This project, carried out in collaboration with other students, includes a dashboard dedicated to monitoring the macroeconomic situation of the BATI company. The dashboard includes graphs generated in Excel and a report written in Word.

The data used come from recognized sources such as INSEE, OECD and the data.gouv.fr platform, and are listed in the report's bibliography.

Although our project has achieved its objectives, we welcome any suggestions for improvements to our future research.
